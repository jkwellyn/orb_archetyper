# orb_archetyper - Project cookie cutter

Command line application to generate a given project type for QA.

# Usage

## Installation

`$ gem install orb_archetyper`

##Help

`$ orb_archetyper -h`

## Create a new project

### A new CLI project not pushed to Github

`$ orb_archetyper -t cli -p <project>`

### A new CLI project immediately pushed to a new Github repo owned by you 

`$ orb_archetyper -t cli -p <project> -u`

### A new CLI project immediately pushed to an upstream Github organization (assuming proper credentials) and your fork

`$ orb_archetyper -t cli -p <project> -u <organization>`

### Fork an existing project from a given organization

You must specify the upstream organization and the project name separated by '/'

`$ orb_archetyper -f auto/orb_archetyper`

### Running the New Project

Shows all the available rake tasks:

`bundle exec rake -T`

Tasks to run tests:

```
rake spec:e2e                                    # Run RSpec code examples
rake spec:full                                   # Run all tests
rake spec:unit                                   # Run RSpec code examples
```

## Github Access
In order for the Github interactions to work, please do the following:

1. Go to https://github.va.opower.it/settings/applications
2. Create a new token
3. Add the following to your .bashrc: `export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>`
4. `. ~/.bashrc`

### Supported project types

1. `cli` - Command line applications
2. `test` - A Rspec Test Project (aka test launcher) that can be configured to be executed against a number of deployment tiers.
3. `bertha_test` - A Rspec Test Project (aka test launcher) specifically to test Bertha jobs
4. `utility` - Utility Project (e.g. a client for a service) to provide a reusable access point to a component/service/application under test.
5. `core` - Core project (e.g. SQL or Rest Connection manager) used to facilitate automated testing common to all QA.
6. `meta` - Meta project (e.g. rails) used to collect related gems into 1 meta gem 

Projects are created with a predefined structure and are autowired with a set configuration.
This includes:

1. Rspec
 + Configured to only accept: the new expect syntax
 + RSpec test implementation for unit and acceptance tests
 + Rendered results reporting for - html/xml/console (jenkins and local)
2. Logging - console and logfile
3. Unit test coverage (simplecov)
4. Documentation (rdoc)
5. Style check (rubocop)
6. Annotations - annotation_manager built on top of rake-notes (TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE)
7. Rake tasks
8. Git project initialization
9. A jenkins build.sh script to simplify how jenkins executes/invokes commands


### Meta projects

#### TODO this section may change as we make more modifications to the archetyper

The orb_archetyper will generate an empty shell of a project when you generate with `-t meta`.  In order to hook in your sub-projects to the meta project:

1. Generate the appropriate project type (likely core or utility) WITHIN the meta project's folder.

2. Add your sub-project to the list of projects within the meta project's Rakefile.

## CI Integration

QA Jenkins Master - http://qa-jenkins-master-1002.va.opower.it:8080/

Jobs for the master branch and for any PRs will automatically get created if:
+ the project has a build.sh at the top level of your project (this is automatically generated for you)
+ the fork the PR is coming from is named the same as the main project 

AND your project is either:
+ in the auto Github organization OR
+ listed on the AUTO_PROJECT_WHITE_LIST whitelist of the job cutter, located here: https://github.va.opower.it/auto/jenkins-seed/blob/master/src/main/groovy/opower/xweb/jenkins/jobs/JobWhiteLists.groovy

You can specify the view that your job will appear under in the ci_metadata.json file using the `jenkins_view` key. If no value is set for `jenkins_view` or no ci_metadata.json file is found, the job will appear on the "No Assigned View" views.
