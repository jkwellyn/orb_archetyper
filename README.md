#orb-archetyper - Project cookie cutter

Command line application to generate an auto-wired project type for AQA. 

Supported project types include:
1. Command line application
2. Test Project (aka test launcher) 
3. Utility Project (e.g. a client for a service)
4. Core project

Projects are created with a predefined structure and are autorired with a set configuration. 
This inlcudes:

* Rspec
+ Configured to only accept: the new expect syntax
+ RSpec test implementation for unit and acceptance tests
+ Rendered results reporting for - html/xml/console (jenkins and local)
* Logging - console and logfile
* Unit test coverage (simplecov)
* Documentation (rdoc)
* Static analysis (rubocop)
* Metrics and stats (metric_fu)
* Annotations - Rake notes (TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE) and orb-moon-raker
* rake tasks
* Git project initialization
* A jenkins build.bash script to simplify how jenkins executes/invokes commands

## Installation
 	
`$ gem install orb-archetyper`

## Usage

###Help

`$ orb-archetyper --help`
`$ orb-archetyper -h`
`$ orb-archetyper -h`

Show all subproject types:
`$ orb-archetyper -e`
  

### Create a new project
Where "project-a "is the name of your project.

`$ orb-archetyper -t cli -p my_project -x coverage -i spec,spec_help -x logs -g`

Note: Inlcude, exlcude is comma separated and comtains no white spaces.
-g does a git init for ya.

`$ orb-archetyper -t cli -p my_project -x coverage -i spec,spec_help -x logs -g`

###Output

Based om the following command, where project name = "command-line":
`$ orb-archetyper -t cli -p comand-line -x coverage -i licence`
