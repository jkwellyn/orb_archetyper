#orb-archetyper - Project cookie cutter

Command line application to generate an auto-wired project type for AQA. 

Supported project types include:

1. Command line applications
2. Test Project (aka test launcher)
3. Utility Project (e.g. a client for a service)
4. Core project (e.g. SQL or Rest Connection manager) 

Projects are created with a predefined structure and are autowired with a set configuration.
This includes:

1. Rspec
 + Configured to only accept: the new expect syntax
 + RSpec test implementation for unit and acceptance tests
 + Rendered results reporting for - html/xml/console (jenkins and local)
2. Logging - console and logfile
3. Unit test coverage (simplecov)
4. Documentation (rdoc)
5. Static analysis (rubocop)
6. Metrics and stats (metric_fu)
7. Annotations - Rake notes (TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE) and orb-moon-raker
8. Rake tasks
9. Git project initialization
10. A jenkins build.bash script to simplify how jenkins executes/invokes commands

## Installation
 	
`$ gem install orb-archetyper`

## Usage

###Help

`$ orb-archetyper --help`
`$ orb-archetyper -h`

`$ orb-archetyper -t cli -p my_project -x coverage -i spec,spec_help -x logs -g`

Note: Include, exclude is comma separated and contains no white space.
-g does a git init for ya.
